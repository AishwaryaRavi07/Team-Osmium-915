A summary of the main topics and concepts in the video on statistical tests, including Z test, t-test,
confidence intervals, significance level, and alternate hypothesis.
Z Test: A statistical test used to determine whether a coin or die is biased or not, calculating the
probability of successes and failures and comparing them to see if there is any significant difference
between the two.
Direct Formula: The direct formula for Z test is X minus NP divided by square root of NP, where X is
the number of successes, N is the number of trials, P is the probability of success, and P is the
probability of failure.
Observed Successes: In this video, the observed successes are 400 times, which means that the
head turned up 400 times out of 500 times.
Probability of Success: The probability of success is 1/2, and the probability of failure is also 1/2.
Significance Level: The significance level is 0.05 by default, which means that we will reject the null
hypothesis if the calculated value of Z is greater than 0.05 or less than -0.05.
Alternate Hypothesis: An opposing statement to the null hypothesis, stating that the sample statistic
is unlikely to be from a population with a specific parameter value.
Confidence Interval: A range of values within which the true parameter is likely to lie, calculated from
the sample statistic using a confidence interval formula.
Test Statistic: A value calculated from the sample data that is used to compare the sample statistic
with the population parameter.
