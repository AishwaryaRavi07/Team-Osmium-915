## Installation

To get started, clone the repo:

`$ git clone https://github.com/zoom/sample-app-web.git`

## Setup

1. Once cloned, navigate to the `sample-app-web/CDN` directory for the Client View CDN sample, or `sample-app-web/Local` for the Client View NPM sample, or `sample-app-web/Components` for the Component View NPM sample:

   `$ cd sample-app-web/CDN` or `$ cd sample-app-web/Local` or `$ cd sample-app-web/Components`

1. Then install the dependencies:

   `$ npm install`

1. Open the directory in your code editor.

1. Open the `sample-app-web/CDN/js/index.js` or `sample-app-web/Local/js/index.js` or `sample-app-web/Components/public/tools/nav.js` file respectively, and insert your Zoom Meeting SDK Key and Secret or Client ID and Client Secret for Meeting SDK app type's created after February 11, 2023, found on the App Credentials page in the Zoom App Marketplace:

   | Key                   | Value Description |
   | -----------------------|-------------|
   | `CLIENT_ID`     | Your Client ID or SDK Key. Required. |
   | `CLIENT_SECRET`  | Your Client Secret or SDK Secret. Required. |

   Example:

   ```js
   var CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_OR_SDK_KEY"
   var CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_OR_SDK_SECRET"
   ```

   > Reminder to not publish this sample app as is. Replace the Meeting SDK JWT generator with a [backend Meeting SDK JWT generator](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/auth/#generate-a-meeting-sdk-jwt) to keep your SDK Secret safe.

1. Save `index.js` or `nav.js` respectively.

1. Run the app:

   `$ npm start`

## Usage

1. Navigate to http://localhost:9999 for the `CDN` or
`Local` sample, or http://localhost:3000 for the `Components` sample. Then, enter in a Meeting or Webinar number and passcode, choose host or attendee (participant), and, click "join".

   ### Client View

   > The Client View provides the option to display the Meeting SDK as a full page. This allows for a familiar Zoom Meeting experience because the Client View is the same as the [Zoom Web Client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443-Zoom-Web-Client), except it lives inside your own web page. 
   #### Nodejs 16
   If you are using Nodejs 16, please use `npm install --force` to proceed with the installation.

   ### Component View
