 Hello students, how are you all? I hope you all are fine. Today in this video we are going to discuss what
is the third use of Z test. What is the third use of Z test? In the last video we discussed that we can check
the proportion. We can also talk about the proportion while using Z test. Today in this video we will
discuss that if we have two data given or two things we have data given by a company or something is
being claimed what is the comparison between those two or what is the comparison between their
proportion? We will talk about that. With example, you will understand it very well. And which formulas are
there that will make this type of question easy? We will talk about all those things. So welcome to Gate
Smashers. My name is Ankit Rodha. Without any delay, let's start. The first thing to see here is what the
formulas are going to look like. In the formula, we will first find out P where P is the probability of success.
We all know this. P is the probability of success. And Q is the probability of failure. First of all, we will find
out P, that is, the probability of success. Now, it is obvious that two samples will be given and two data
will be given. So we will have different probabilities of both. So P1 and P2 here will be the probability of
success of sample A and sample B. That is, what is the probability of success in sample A and sample B?
That is P1 and P2. N1 and N2 will be the total sample of B and this will be the sample of A. That is, how
many numbers of samples are being chosen in A and how many numbers of samples are being chosen in
B. So it is obvious that we are talking about two data. So their sample size and their probability or
favorable or total are going to be different. So we will find out this first. After that, we will go to Z
calculated. That is, we will put Z test. P1 and P2, I have just told you. The difference between the two. We
have also read the value of probability of success, N failure and N1 and N2. Formulas are in front of you.
Let's discuss a question so that it will be clear with love. See, as the statement of the question is in front
of you. It says, in a random sample of 800 persons from Delhi and 600, in a random sample of 800
persons from Delhi, 600 persons from Delhi and 600 are found to be non-veg. What data do we have in
this example? In Delhi, I have 800 out of 800 people who like to eat non-veg food or who are non-veg.
The first data. And from Gurgaon, 700 like non-veg out of 1200. Out of every 1200 people in Gurgaon,
700 people like non-veg food or are non-veg. It has given two data on an average. If we choose 800
people as a sample, then 600 of them will be non-veg. In Gurgaon, I have the data of Delhi and here I
have shown the data of Gurgaon. Two different cities' data is being shown here. Two different samples
are being taken out. Then it says, do these data indicate that this is the significant difference in the front, if
the level of significance is 5%? It says, is there any difference in this data? If there is a difference, then
check and show where the level of significance is 5%. Level of significance in the sense, we are talking
about the percentage of error that we saw in the hypothesis. If you are not able to understand the level of
significance, then continue the previous 2-3 videos and read the hypothesis. You will be clear. Everything
is in this playlist. Now, let's understand this data in a good way. Now, if I put my term and condition, my
formulas, it says, Let's assume that the data of Delhi is N1. How many people were chosen for the total
sample? 800 people. N2, that is, how many people were chosen for the total sample of Gurgaon? 1200
people. Now, from N1, that is, from Delhi, how many people are such who are non-vegetarians? How
many people are such? 600. That is, its probability of success. Now, probability of success means that
non-vegetarians are from Delhi. So, 600 divided by 800. This will be 0s divided by 0s. 2 3s, 2 4s. So, that
is, 3 by 4. I got the answer. Now, if we talk about P2. How many people are non-vegetarians here? 700
out of 1200. So, how much did I get the answer? 7 by 12. That is, N1 P2, N1 N2 P1 and N2 P2. That is,
all these things came. Now, let's talk about the main probability of success. Which is representing the
whole data. So, the main probability of success is P1 in N1 and N2. That is, the multiply of these two.
Which will automatically come out to be 600. Plus the multiply of these two. Which will automatically come
out to be 700. Divided by N1 plus N2. That is, 800 plus 1200. That is, 2000. See, what is this formula?
What is the formula? What is this total value? Total favorable cases and total outcomes. How? How many
people are non-vegetarians? 7 plus 6 is 1300 out of 2000. So, that is the answer. So, put it in this. Or
understand it directly. It is the same thing. So, this is 13 divided by. Sorry. If there is a disturbance in the
audio, then ignore it a little. Right? 20 in 13 by. So, this is the value of my P. That is, the value of success.
The probability of success is there. So, it is very easy to find out the failure. So, how much value of Q will
I get? Minus it from 1. Which is equal to 7 by 20. Now, we have to apply only the Z test. Let's see the
value of Z. What does Z say? P1 minus P2. That is, 3 by 4 minus 7 by 12. Square root of PQ in 1 by. P.
PQ in 1 by. So, the value that we are given, we will change the formula here. This is not 1 by PQ. This is
only PQ. Okay? So, we have the value of PQ. 20 in 13 by. And, multiplied by 20 in 7 by. In 1 by, N1. Howmuch is N1? 800. Plus, in 1 by, N2. That is, 1200. So, this is the value. How much was it in 7 by? It was
12. 12, I got LCM. This is 3, 3 is 9. Minus 7. Whole divided by 20. It came out here. That is, 1 by 20. This
is 7. 7 into 13. 91. And, as we are taking LCM, it is 12, 2000. 2400. And, here, it will come. The value is
24. And, 3 and 2 is 5. That is, 4 by 55. 2400 came in the root. So, after calculating all this, we have the
answer. As it is, 7.65. Okay? Calculation is your part. 7.65. I have the answer. It is coming out. What does
this mean? That the Z calculated, that is, the value of Z calculated came to me. 7.65. And, the value of Z
tabulated is 5% of level of significance. 1.96. I provided you the table. Otherwise, I will show it. So, here,
the calculated value is greater than our tabulated value. This means that the null hypothesis is rejected.
That is, H0 is rejected. And, H0 is rejected means that the claim that is being done, that is being told that
is there any difference between them, what are we taking? If I mention H0 here clearly, then, here,
according to this statement, the meaning of H0 will be that P1 is equal to P2. That there is no much
difference in the probability of both. It will work a little. That 600 out of 800 people are non-veg, or 700 out
of 1200 people are non-veg. That was it. And, H1, the alternate hypothesis said that there is a difference
between them. There is a difference in the probability of this data. There is a difference in the probability
of non-veg. So, if our null hypothesis is rejected, it means that the alternate hypothesis will be corrected.
It will be accepted that yes, there is a difference in the data. Let's understand one more small question. I
am showing you the question on the screen. It says that 500 people like juice out of 1000. Out of 1000,
500 people are liking juice. Right? And then it says that 700 people like juice out of 1200. So, we have
data of two cities. In one city, 500 people like it. In the other, 700 people like it. Out of these, is there any
difference in this data? Where 1% of level of significance is there. So, let's do it quickly. The value of N1
is 1000. The value of N2 is 1200. So, how much will P1 get? 500 divided by 1000. That is 1 by 2. How
much will P2 get? 700 divided by this. 7 by 12. So, what is the probability of success? N1 P1 means this
into this. Again, 500 plus N2 P2 which is equal to 700 divided by total data N1 plus N2 means 2200. So, I
got the answer. 1200 divided by 1000. 2200 which is equal to 6 divided by 11. So, if the probability of
success is 6 by 11, what will be the failure? Minus from 1. Do the same Z test. Z test says P1 minus P2
means 1 by 2 minus 7 by 12 whole divided by PQ. PQ is 6 by 11 into 5 by 11. 1 by N1 plus 1 by N2. That
is 1 by 1000 plus 1 by 1200. So, after solving all the data, the value of Z calculated is minus 3.98. And
what is the level of significance? 1%. If I have 1% level of significance, then the value of Z calculated is
1.65. If 1% level of significance is there, you can see from the table, where the mod is placed. But here
the value is coming as minus 3.98. And what does this mean? It can be done between minus 1.65 and
1.65. Is it doing it? This means that the null hypothesis is rejected again. The same thing will happen that
yes, there is a difference between both the data. So, this was our third important use of the Z test. Where
we are going to have the last video of this Z test. And in the next video, we will discuss about the new
topic. So, I hope you will like this third use of Z test. You must have understood it. Like every time, this
time also, you will get the file link in the description. Keep all the formulas of hypothesis with you. For
revision in the exam time, quickly within one or two hours, you have to go through all the formulas once.
So, let's meet in the next video. We will talk about a new topic. Have a good day to all of you. If you have
got something to learn in the video, then you will definitely like and share the video. Let's meet in the next
video, same time, same place, next day. Have a good day to all of you. Bye-bye. Bye.
